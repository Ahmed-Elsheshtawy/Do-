# To-Do List App

A simple and clean to-do list web application for managing daily tasks.

## Why is this one different?
Well, To be honest, there is probably tons of better To-Do List Web applications that are far better than this one. But for me, this one is my favorite because **I made it myself as a practice without using AI or any assistance. 100% BY ME!**
